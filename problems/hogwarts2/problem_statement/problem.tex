\problemname{Hogwarts}

The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is the home of many
students during the school year.  The school has many rooms connected
by corridors and stairs.  Each room has four exits labelled by the
integers $1, 2, 3$ or $4$.  Some exits lead to another room, some of them
are blocked, and some even lead back to the same room you just came
from.

New students often have difficulty finding their way, especially since
the corridors and stairs are regularly moving, disconnecting and
reconnecting different rooms!  Luckily, these reconfigurations only
take place when no one is walking in the school.  All you want to know
is how to get from the entrance to the dormitory.  A senior student
has given you instructions as a sequence of numbers among $1, 2, 3, 4$.
The first number in the sequence is the exit to take from the starting
room.  The second number is the exit to take from the second room in
the path, and so on.  If at any point the indicated exit is blocked,
you go back to the entrance and give up.  To be successful you must
arrive at the dormitory at the end of the entire sequence.  Even if it
appears you have reached the dormitory before the entire sequence is
followed, you are not sure if that is an illusion.  Therefore you 
follow the entire sequence.

You carefully followed the instructions and arrived at the dormitory.
However, the way the rooms are connected to each other has changed
after the senior student gave you the instructions, and you just
happen to arrive at the same destination even if the rooms you
encountered along the way may be completely different.

You wonder if you are just lucky, or if the reconfiguration of the
corridors and stairs ensures that the instructions still lead you
to the same destination. Isn't that magical?

You will be given a configuration of the school when the senior
student walked from the entrance to the dormitory, as well as the
configuration of the school when you start following the given
instructions.  You want to know if every possible sequence of
instructions that led the senior student to the
dormitory will also lead you to the dormitory in the configuration
you walk through.  Both the senior student and you start walking from
the entrance of the school.

\section*{Input}

The first line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 1\,000$),
indicating the number of rooms in the school.  The rooms are numbered
$1$ to $n$, where room $1$ is the entrance and room $n$ is the dormitory.

The next $n$ lines of input describe the configuration of the school when the
senior student walked to the dormitory, followed by another $n$ lines
describing the configuration of the school when you start to walk to the
dormitory.

The $i^\textrm{th}$ line in the school configuration consists of four
non-negative integers, indicating which room exits $1, 2, 3$ and $4$
lead to.  If the room number is $0$, the corresponding exit is
blocked.

\section*{Output}

If it is not possible for the senior student to walk from the entrance
to the dormitory, display \texttt{Impossible}.

If it is possible, display \texttt{Yes} if you can get from the entrance to
the dormitory by following any sequence of instructions
taking the senior student from the entrance to the dormitory.  Otherwise, display \texttt{No}.

\problemname{Fantasy Draft}

In fantasy hockey, there are $n$ team owners that each selects $k$
hockey players.  To determine which owner gets which players, the
owners hold a draft.

The draft proceeds as follows: the first owner may select any player,
then the second owner can select any player except the player taken
first and so on. In general, the current owner may take any player
that has not been taken previously.  Once all owners have selected one
player, they repeat this process until all owners have selected $k$
players.  No player may be selected by multiple teams.

Initially, all players are given a ranking based on how well they
played in the previous year. However, the owners may not agree with
this order. For example, the first owner may believe that the player
which was ranked third in the previous year is the best player and
would prefer to take them.

Each owner has a preference list. On their
turn, the owner selects the player that is the highest available
player on their own preference list.  If all players on their
preference list are taken, then they resort to using the ordering from
the previous year.

Given the preference list of each owner and the rankings from the
previous year, which players did each owner get?

\section*{Input}

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$
($1 \leq n \leq 60$), the number of owners, and $k$
($1 \leq k \leq 1\,000$), the size of each team.

The next $n$ lines contain owners' preferences in the order of
drafting.  Each line starts with an integer $q_i$ ($0 \leq q_i \leq 1\,500$), the size of the
$i^\textrm{th}$ owners' preference list.  $q_i$ names follow, separated by
spaces, in order of $i^\textrm{th}$ owner's preference. No name appears
more than once in the $i^\textrm{th}$ owners' list.

The next line contains a single integer $p$
($n \cdot k \leq p \leq 65\,000$), indicating the number of players in
the draft.

The next $p$ lines each contain a single name, they are ordered by
their previous year's ranking.  Each player name is unique and
 comprised of at most $12$ letters of English alphabet.

The names in owners' preference lists are guaranteed to appear in the
player list.

\section*{Output}

Display $n$ lines. The $i^\textrm{th}$ of which contains the $k$ names of the
players that were selected by the $i^\textrm{th}$ owner.  The $n$ teams
should be in the original order of owners and players should be listed
in the order in which they were drafted following the rules above.

\problemname{Piece of Cake!}

It is Greg's birthday! To celebrate, his friend Sam invites Greg and
two other friends for a small party. Of course, every birthday party
must have cake.

Sam ordered a square cake.  She makes a single horizontal cut and a
single vertical cut.  In her excitement to eat cake, Sam forgot to
make these cuts through the middle of the cake.

Of course, the biggest piece of cake should go to Greg since it is his
birthday. Help Sam determine the volume of the
biggest piece of cake that resulted from these two cuts.

\section*{Input}
The input consists of a single line containing three integers $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10\,000$),
the length of the sides of the square cake in centimeters, $h$ ($0 < h < n$), 
the distance of the horizontal cut from the top edge of the cake
in centimeters, and $v$ ($0 < v < n$), the distance of the vertical cut
from the left edge of the cake in centimeters.  This is illustrated in
the figure above.

Each cake is $4$ centimeters thick.

\section*{Output}
Display the volume (in cubic centimeters) of the largest of the four pieces
of cake after the horizontal and vertical cuts are made.

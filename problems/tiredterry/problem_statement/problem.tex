\problemname{Tired Terry}

Terry is feeling tired and he suspects it is because of a lack of sleep. 
He created a device that records his sleeping pattern over a period of 
time measured in seconds.

Assuming that the recorded sleeping pattern keeps repeating,
help Terry by letting him know how often he is tired during each of the repeating time periods.

More precisely, for integers $p$ and $d$, we say that Terry is tired
at second $i$ if from second $i-p+1$ to second $i$ (inclusive) he has
slept for less than $d$ seconds.

\section*{Input}

The first line of input contains three integers $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 
86\,400$), the length of Terry's sleep pattern, $p$ ($1 \leq p \leq n$), 
and $d$ ($1 \leq d \leq p$) as described above.

The second line of input contains a single string of length $n$ which 
describes the period of time that is recorded. The $i^\textrm{th}$ such 
character is a \texttt{W} if Terry is awake at the $i^\textrm{th}$ second, or is 
a \texttt{Z} if Terry is asleep at the $i^\textrm{th}$ second.

\section*{Output}

Display a single integer which represents the number of seconds that Terry 
is tired during each of the repeating time periods.

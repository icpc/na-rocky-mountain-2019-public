\problemname{Folding a Cube}

It is well known that a set of six unit squares
that are attached together in a ``cross'' can be folded into a cube.

But what about other initial shapes? That is, given six
unit squares that are attached together along some of their sides,
can we form a unit cube by folding this arrangement?

\section*{Input}

Input consists of $6$ lines each containing $6$ characters, describing
the initial arrangement of unit squares. Each character is either a \verb|.|,
meaning it is empty, or a \verb|#| meaning it is a unit square.

There are precisely $6$ occurrences of \verb|#| indicating
the unit squares. These form a connected component, meaning
it is possible to reach any \verb|#| from any other \verb|#| without
touching a \verb|.| by making only horizontal and vertical movements.
Furthermore, there is no $2 \times 2$ subsquare consisting
of only \verb|#|. That is, the pattern
\begin{verbatim}
##
##
\end{verbatim}
does not appear in the input.

\section*{Output}

If you can fold the unit squares into a cube, display \verb|can fold|.
Otherwise display \verb|cannot fold|.
